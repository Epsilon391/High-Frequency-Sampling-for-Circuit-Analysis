2/14:
	- Finished Assembling and testing the first DSO138
	- Started assembly of the second DSO138
	- Started research on communicating with the DSO138
2/21:
	- Explored options for DSO138 communication including:
		1. SPI
		2. USART
		3. Uart to USB
		4. Mini USB to USB
	- Failed test, Uart communication (PI to DSO) using Mini-Com
	- Investigated Tektronix software and verified DSO138 testing procedures.

2/28:
	- Attempted Arduino to Arduino Uart communication and ran into issues with available serial ports. Was able to communicate in a single direction
	- Failed attempt to communicate from Arduino to DSO
	- Found DSO138 source code and additional Github resources
	- Started to investigate alternative firmware versions


3/6:
	- Successfully Updated DSO138 Firmware
	- Successfully read boot message from DSO138 via USART
	- Successfully read voltages from the DSO138 to the Raspberry Pi via UART

3/13:
	- Discovered Voltage measurements were inconsistent
	- Searched for modified DLO138 source code
	- Discovered possible issue with the timescale of the DSO138 capture function
	- Made attempts to build other DSO138 projects and understand the make files
